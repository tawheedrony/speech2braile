Speech to Braille Generation for people with Auditory &amp; Visual Impairment


We have developed this project as part of our course titled 'Microprocessor & Embedded System'. 
For this task, we have taken a software program of phone that captures the spoken words of a speaker and converts them to text, 
and then converts each letters into Braille signals. We have implemented this in Proteus where, 
using a Bluetooth module we captured the converted texts from a software and sent the texts to STM32F103C6. 
Finally STM32F103C6 converts the texts into Braille and shows them via LED lights.
